Digital luncheons: each month, a digital word decyphered.

### MISSION

We propose to organise each month, a meeting at lunchtime to discuss of the intersection betwteen technique & society. Opened to the public physically and via IRC, all the content is streamed in video and documentation shared.

### 5 GOALS

1. Developping, in a room accessible to the public (25 persons max), long term intellectual reflections on political topics linked with technology, inspired by [Digital Luncheon](https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/luncheon) from Berkman Klein Center and [Hackerspaces](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/Hackerspaces) contrasting with the short time of social media and accelerationist metaphors.

2. Leaning on the values of a place where it is still possible to take time to think together, confronting different perspectives, in a peaceful way.

3. Allowing non-professionals of politics to perpetuate free discussion, in the respect of the originality of their thinking, and in the context of public resonance (pseudonymous participation via IRC, live video streaming of events, real-time production of a shared collaborative documentation)

4. Dynamically regulate the program of the place by providing from the beginning a 'soft' thematic framework that could then be redefined by the governance of the project (place, initiators) but also by contributors like in the [Nomic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic) system.

5. Producing free software and technical systems associated with these reflections, in a logic of collaborative contribution, sharing source codes and documentation via a [public GIT account](https://dejnum.github.io/).
